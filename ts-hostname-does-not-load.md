# Why doesn't my hostname load on the browser when {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Object Storage (COS) is the origin?
{: #troubleshoot-cdn-hostname-does-not-load}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

When your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CDN is configured to use COS as the object storage, direct access to the website does not work.
{: shortdesc}

This behavior is caused by the index document limitation in IBM COS.
{: tsCauses}

You must specify the complete request path in the browser's address bar (for example, `www.example.com/index.html`). For an alternative solution, see [How do I use the ICOS default index page with CDN](/docs/CDN?topic=CDN-configure-cdn-with-ibm-cloud-object-storage#using-icos-default-index-with-cdn).
