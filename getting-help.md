# Getting help and support

When using the forum to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development teams. If you have technical questions about CDN, post your question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=cdn+ibm-cloud){:external} and tag your question with "cdn" and "ibm-cloud".

You can also open an IBM Support case in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external}.
